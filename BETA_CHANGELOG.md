<h3>Version 10.132.1 beta <span class="date">16/1/2025</span></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Update to Chromium 132.0.6834.83</li>
  <li>Fix a UI issue where the add app wizard would show the next button offscreen</li>
  <li>
    We're continuing to expand our support for new WebGPU APIs in line with other
    browsers, to make WebGPU in the browser more capable. This open new possibilities
    for sites to utilize WebGPU for more advanced graphics and other exciting things
    like on-device AI. New features include support for Texture view usage, 32-bit float
    texture blending, experimental support for 16-bit normalized texture formats and more.
  </li>
  <li>
    We've been improving the dialog element that sites can use for easy on-screen
    dialogs and popups. Although the dialog element is widely supported across browsers,
    it's been missing a few important event handlers that make it more useful for sites.
    Alongside the web-specification, we've added support for these additional events so
    sites can make more use of this feature.
  </li>
  <li>
    Further support for network request handlers to deal with raw data as opposed
    to needing to pre-serialize data and run expensive deserialization tasks. This
    should lead to improved performance for sites that choose to use it.
  </li>
  <li>Update dependencies</li>
</ul>
