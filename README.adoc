= Welcome to the Spinnaker Project

Spinnaker is an open-source continuous delivery platform for releasing software changes with high velocity and confidence.  Spinnaker provides a single platform that allows you to safely deploy and manage your application in multiple cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes and more!).  With automated canary analysis and multiple ways to initiate deployments, you can safely promote your code from a git commit into a dev environment all the way through multiple production environments with confidence in the results.  Spinnaker is the most mature and widely productionalized continuous delivery platform built upon the work of Netflix, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and numerous other companies to allow fast, safe deploys. Used by numerous organizations including Target, Salesforce, Airbnb, Cerner, Adobe, JPMorgan Chase and more!

- Functions

Facilitate GitOps, and grant developers control of provisioning infrastructure for apps. Use Spinnaker’s Clouddriver to deploy to all of the major public cloud providers and Kubernetes. You may even orchestrate configuration and firmware changes as part of Spinnaker delivery https://www.spinnaker.io/docs/concepts/#pipeline[pipelines].

= Why Do I Need Spinnaker?

Use Spinnaker to create a “paved road” for application delivery, with guardrails that ensure only valid infrastructure and configuration reach production.

Free development teams from burdensome ops provisioning while automating reinforcement of business and regulatory requirements. Delivery automation strategies such as canary deployments provide the safety necessary to capture value from quick innovation, while protecting against business and end-user impact.
 
= Tech Specs

Spinnaker consists of a number of https://www.spinnaker.io/reference/architecture/[independent microservices], with the https://github.com/spinnaker/halyard[Halyard CLI tool] or the https://www.armory.io/spinnaker-community/spinnaker-operator/[Kubernetes Operator] (Beta)
managing the lifecycle of the other services. A https://www.spinnaker.io/docs/setup/other_config/[variety of SDLC tools] integrate with Spinnaker, and its plugin framework makes Spinnaker more easily customizable to your needs. Plugins allow us to add system integrations without updating Spinnaker, broadening its potential
to easily leverage the entire software delivery toolchain. With this in place, Spinnaker is evolving towards a smaller threat surface,
enabling performance and operational advantages. Meanwhile, managed delivery, a newer Spinnaker featureset, provides declarative definitions of common
infrastructure and other requirements; users can declare requirements using those
prebuilt definitions and move changes through environments via a visual interface.

'''

This repository centralizes issue tracking across Spinnaker for each microservice. 
The core code making up Spinnaker’s microservices is found in the other https://github.com/spinnaker[Spinnaker repositories].
